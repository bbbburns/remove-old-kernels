Remove Old Kernels
------------------
# Purpose
The intent of this small script is to find old Linux kernels and their installed packages and remove them using "dpkg".

# Warning
This is many years old and is potentially unsafe depending on the particulars of your own setup. It works for me based on how I use my system. You might be better served just using apt with autoremove.
